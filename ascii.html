  <h1 class="glow">ASCII </h1>
  <h2 class="glow2">American Standard Code for Information Interchange</h2>
  <p>ASCII is a common way computers and the internet understand text. It uses special numbers for each letter, number, and symbol, with a total of 128 unique characters and control codes in standard ASCII-encoded data.</p>

  <p>In ASCII encoding, you'll find uppercase and lowercase letters from A to Z, numbers from 0 to 9, and basic punctuation marks. It also includes certain control characters, initially meant for teletype printing terminals, which aren't visible but have specific functions.</p>
  <p> ASCII can be represented in many ways. Here are some:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>as pairs of hexadecimal digits, which are numbers in base-16 format. This means they can be depicted using the digits 0 through 9, as well as the letters A through F to represent values from 10 to 15 in the decimal system.</li>
    <li>
      as three-digit octal (base 8) numbers
    </li>
    <li>
      as decimal numbers from 0 to 127
    </li>
    <li>
      as 7-bit or 8-bit binary 
    </li>
  </ol>
